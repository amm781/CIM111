  <h1 id="about"> What is gelato?</h1>

  <section id="grid1">
    <p> For many gelato is just another way of saying ice cream but these two sweet and savory desserts aren't
       exactly the same. If you ever test trial the two desserts side by side you will clearly notice that
       gelato is much creamier than ice cream. This is because while both desserts contain milk, cream,
       and sugar, the ratio of these ingredients is not the same. Authentic gelato has a heavy emphasis on milk
       rather than cream. This along with sparse use of egg yolks in gelato are what makes its dense
       conistency and silky texture.

    <p>The exact origin of gelato is a little hazy, no one exactly knows who created it first
       but many place the dessert's birth place in Florence. The word itself is derived from the Italian
       word 'congelato' which means frozen. The first ever gelato machine was created in Sicily in 1686
       by a man of the name Francesco Propocio dei Coltelli. Yet, the populaity of gelato wasn't really present
       until the 1920's. However, the industy has boomed in recent decades especially in the US, where it has annually
       generated 2 billion in revenue in recent years.

    <p> Gelato is not simply confined to be eaten in a cone or cup. As seen in the picture, ordering gelato
       in a brioche bun is a very popular way to have gelato, as it essenially creates the effect of a
       freshly made ice cream sandwich. Furthermore, people often ask for freshly made espresso to be poured over their
       gelato, creating an entirely different delicacy known as 'Affogato'. Lastly, there are Italian versions of
       milkshakes with gelato being blended with milk to create a 'Frulato'.
