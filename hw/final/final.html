    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <section>
    <p>In name at least, there had always been a Juventus Club at the Football Fcatory
      at Legends in New York City. But the club was not organized well, and turnouts
      for games were low. Six people were inspired to change the culture, knowing that
      a prestigious team such as Juventus could produce a much larger and more engaging
      community in New York City. Working together, those six fans spent months laying
      the groundwork for a new and improved fan club. In 2015, we hosted our first watch party under
      the new leadership.Two years later after facing trials and tribulations, we were
      able to to succesfully become Juventus Official Fan Club Empire State. Uniting
      with smaller fan clubs across the city to create one.</p>

For example, if you want a container ".main" to trigger an image shuffle instead of the image itself, put $(".main") for this option. Default value is false.
         mouseMoveTrigger: 20,          // For "imageMouseMove" only, you can set how many pixels you have to move in order to trigger one image shuffle. The lower the faster. The default value is 50.
         hoverTrigger: 200,             // For "imageHover" only, you can set how long you have to hover the image until it shuffles to other images. The option accepts milliseconds without unit. The default value is 200.
         scrollTrigger: 100,          // For "documentScroll" only, you can set how many pixels you have to scroll to see the image shuffle. The default value is 100.
